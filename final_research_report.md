# Physics-Involved Neural Networks: A Research Report

## Executive Summary
This report provides an analysis of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their application in solving complex physical dynamics problems. Two recent studies were examined to understand how these networks integrate physical laws into the learning process for improved accuracy and efficiency. The first study focuses on friction-involved nonsmooth dynamics, and the second explores variance-involved PINNs for partial differential equations (PDEs). The key findings emphasize the ability of PINNs to enhance predictive capabilities in complex physical systems through the inclusion of physical laws in the modeling process.

## Suggested Direct Answers
- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) leverage physical laws to optimize neural network predictions for complex dynamic systems.
- Applying PINNs to nonsmooth dynamics with friction leads to more accurate simulation results in physical systems involving discontinuities.
- Variance-involved PINNs offer efficient and precise solutions to complex PDEs by accounting for variances inherent in the data, enhancing computational performance.
