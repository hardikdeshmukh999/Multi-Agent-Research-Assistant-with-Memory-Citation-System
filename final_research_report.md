# Research Report: Optimization Algorithms in WBAN and Fog Computing

## Executive Summary

This report examines the use of optimization algorithms, specifically the Greedy Spider Monkey Algorithm, in enhancing system reliability and resource management. Two studies are reviewed: one focuses on improving the reliability of IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN), and the other on resource management in fog computing environments. The key findings illustrate the effectiveness of using Greedy Spider Monkey Optimization techniques in both contexts, providing improvements in network reliability and efficient resource allocation.

## Key Findings

- **Improvement in WBAN Reliability**: The use of the Greedy Spider Monkey Algorithm significantly enhances the reliability of IEEE 802.15.4 WBANs, ensuring better performance and data transmission efficiency.
- **Efficient Resource Management in Fog Computing**: Implementing greedy and semi-greedy methods optimizes resource management in fog computing, leading to improved system performance and resource utilization.
