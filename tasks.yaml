  description: >
    Conduct a comprehensive search for papers on: {topic}.
    
    MANDATORY EXECUTION PLAN:
    1. ANALYZE the topic to identify core entities (Models, Methods, Domains).
    2. REFINE the query by removing stop words (e.g., remove "using", "application of", "based on").
       - Example Input: "Predicting mortality rate using AI"
       - Refined Search: "Predicting mortality rate AI"
    3. CALL "OpenAlex Search" with this optimized query string.
    4. If results are poor, try a broader variation (e.g., remove specific model names).
    5. Compile the valid results found.
    
    DO NOT proceed without calling the tool.
  
  expected_output: >
    A list of REAL papers fetched from OpenAlex. Each entry must have:
    - Title
    - Year
    - Author
    - Link (DOI/URL)
    - Abstract
    - Source ("OpenAlex" or "Memory")
  
  agent: librarian

review_task:
  description: >
    You are the Critic. Your job is to review every paper the Librarian provided and produce a clear, structured approval list for the Scribe.
    
    The search query used for this research was: "{topic}". Use it to judge relevance.
    
    MANDATORY STEPS (do them in order):
    
    1. LIST EACH PAPER
       - Go through the Librarian's output one by one. For each paper, note: Title, Year, Author, Link, and Abstract (when provided).
    
    2. VALIDATE EACH PAPER (Abstract is PRIMARY over Title)
       For each paper, check:
       - LINK: Does it have a valid Link (DOI or OpenAlex URL)? If missing or invalid → REJECT.
       - SOURCE: Is the paper in the Librarian's list (not made up)? If not in the list → REJECT.
       - RELEVANCE (Abstract has priority over Title):
         * When Abstract is provided (not "(not provided)"): The abstract is the PRIMARY source. If the abstract clearly relates to the query (same domain, key terms, research question) → ACCEPT. If the abstract does NOT relate to the query → REJECT. Do NOT reject based on title alone when the abstract supports relevance.
         * When Abstract is "(not provided)" (e.g. from Memory): Use Title only as fallback; be slightly more lenient but reject clearly off-topic papers.
    
    3. DECIDE
       - ACCEPT: Valid link, in Librarian's list, and (when abstract present) abstract supports relevance. Abstract outweighs title.
       - REJECT: Missing link, not in list, or (when abstract present) abstract does not support relevance.
    
    4. OUTPUT FORMAT
       - First, a short summary: "Reviewed N papers. Approved M; rejected K."
       - Then a numbered list of APPROVED papers only, each line: Title | Author | Year | Link
       - Do NOT include rejected papers in the final list.
    
    IDENTIFY the "Winner" (Highest Quality Score).IDENTIFY the "Contenders" (The rest).
    DO NOT approve any paper without a link. DO NOT add papers that were not in the Librarian's output. When abstract is present, use it to check query relevance.
  expected_output: >
    A short review summary (counts of reviewed / approved / rejected) followed by a numbered list of APPROVED papers only, each with Title, Author, Year, Link. Relevance must be verified using the Abstract (from abstract_inverted_index when from API) against the search query; no fake or unlinked papers. A structured list separating the "Winner" (Best Paper) from the "Contenders.
